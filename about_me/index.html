    <p>Hello Everyone,jhkjskjdhakdhakdkahkAH</p>
    <br>
    <p>My name is Arthur Bitgue from Philippines. I am happily married with a 3-year old daughter. I served my mission in Phillipines Davao Mission way back 2015-2017. I am currently working as a data manager in real estate but want to shift as a developer in the future. I fell inlove in programming and I think this is what I like to do. I am happy to be in this class and excited to learn from all of you.  </p>
